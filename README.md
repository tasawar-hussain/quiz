# Quiz Application

This project is a dynamic and interactive quiz application built using the latest web technologies. It features a responsive and visually appealing user interface, allowing users to navigate through a series of questions, with the ability to move back and forth, change answers, and view results at the end. The project follows modern coding standards and best practices, making it easy to maintain and scale.

## 🌟 Project Description

The Quiz Application is designed to handle various types of questions including True / False and open-ended questions. It leverages React's component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. The application also uses React Hook Form to manage form state efficiently and follows the Atomic Design methodology to organize components.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **React**: v18.0.0
- **TypeScript**: v5.5.0
- **rsbuild**: v1.0.0
- **Node.js**: v20 (LTS)
- **pnpm**: v9.8.0
- **corepack**: For managing package managers

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Enable Corepack

Corepack comes bundled with Node.js to manage package managers like `pnpm`, `yarn`, etc.

```bash
corepack enable
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

After enabling Corepack, install the project dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## 📦 Third-Party Libraries

- **React Hook Form**: v7.53.0 - For handling form state.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Guidelines

The project follows the **Atomic Design** methodology, which breaks down the UI into smaller, reusable components, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

## 🎨 Styling

Styling is managed using **CSS Modules**, ensuring that styles are scoped locally by default, preventing style conflicts and making the application easier to manage.

## ✅ Code Quality

- **Prettier**: v3.3.0 - For code formatting, ensuring a consistent style across the codebase.
- **ESLint**: v9.9.0 - For identifying and fixing problems in the code, ensuring adherence to best practices.

## 📊 Coverage

**TODO:** Implement test coverage to ensure that all components and logic are well-tested.
